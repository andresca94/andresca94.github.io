**Summarization:** In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune a pretrained summarization module which summarize texts in Spanish using the fine-tuned multilanguage mT5 encoder/decorder architecture.

**Neural Machine Translation:** In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune a pretrained NMT module which translates texts from Spanish to English using the multilanguage mT5 encoder/decorder architechture.

<div style="text-align: justify">This project cover 2 approaches, the first simple recommender does the following: Decide on the metric or score to rate movies on. Calculate the score for every movie. Sort the movies based on the score and output the top results. The second approach build a system that recommends movies that are similar to a particular movie to finally create the recommendation based on the following metadata: the 3 top actors, the director, related genres, and the movie plot keywords. Compute pairwise cosine similarity scores for all movies based on their plot descriptions and recommend movies based on that similarity score threshold. Tokenized, vectorized text data using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to get a content based recommender and credits, genres, and keywords based recommender.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

## Data Science

### MasterCard stock price time series forecasting using LSTM and GRU

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Solutions/tree/master/assignments/)

<div style="text-align: justify">RNN remembers past inputs due to an internal memory which is useful for predicting stock prices, generating text, transcriptions, and machine translation. In this notebook I'll use LSTM and GRU that are an advanced type of RNN. RNN simple structure suffers from short memory, where it struggles to retain previous time step information in larger sequential data. These problems can easily be solved by long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), as they are capable of remembering long periods of information. In this notebook I will show you a preprocessed dataset from May-25-2006 to Oct-11-202 and how to built machine learning models to predict the stock price using both LSTM and GRU.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
